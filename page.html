    <p>Hello world</p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Brayden and I attended St Johns Prep High school. 
       There are variety of activities that I enjoy in my free time.
       The hobbies that I enjoy are robotics, mathamatics, swimming, coding, and guitar playing.
        Coding is one of my favorite hobbies providing me the oppertunity to explore more about software 
        including interning as a frontend developer. I enjoy traveling to places such as Spain, London, 
        and Bolivia allowing me the oppertunity to see the world.
    </p>
